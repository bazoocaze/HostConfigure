VBUS is the micro-USB input voltage, connected to micro-USB port pin 1. If you use a 5V power supply from USB, this will be nominally 5V (or 0V if the USB is not connected or not powered).

VSYS is the main system input voltage, which can vary in the allowed range 1.8V to 5.5V, and is used by the on-board SMPS (Switched Mode Power Supply) to generate the 3.3V for the RP2040 and its GPIO.

3V3_EN connects to the on-board SMPS enable pin, and is pulled high (to VSYS) via a 100K resistor. To disable the 3.3V (which also de-powers the RP2040), short this pin low.

3V3 is the main 3.3V supply to RP2040 and its I/O, generated by the on-board SMPS. This pin can be used to power external circuitry (maximum output current will depend on RP2040 load and VSYS voltage, it is recommended to keep the load on this pin less than 300mA).
